powerman: powerman (cluster power management utility)
powerman:
powerman: Powerman is free UNIX/Linux software that controls (remotely and in
powerman: parallel) switched power distribution units.  It was designed for
powerman: remote power control of Linux systems in a data center or cluster
powerman: environment, but has been used in other environments such as embedded
powerman: management appliances, home automation, and high availability service
powerman: management.
powerman: Powerman can be extended to support new devices using an expect-like
powerman: scripting language. It communicates with devices natively using
powerman: telnet, raw socket, and serial protocols.  It also can drive virtual
powerman: power control devices via a coprocess interface.  The coprocess
powerman: mechanism has been used to extend powerman to communicate with
powerman: devices using other protocols such as SNMP, IPMI, Insteon, X-10, and
powerman: VXI-11.  Powerman can control equipment connected using any
powerman: combination of the above methods and provide unified naming for the
powerman: equipment and parallel execution of control actions.
